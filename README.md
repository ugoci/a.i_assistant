<h1> Building an A.I Voice Assistant with APIs </h1>
<b> Note: </b> This is a simplified program for educational purposes.
<br />

<h2> Overview </h2>
This program allows you build and run a simple a.i voice assistant on your device. 
<br />

<h2> How the program works </h2>
The program works by following these steps: <br />
<ul> 
  <li>Taking inputs from a user (speech) </li>
  <li>Using the Google Text to Speech program to turn the inputs into text </li>
  <li>Sending the text through the OpenAI API to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model </li>
  <li>Receiving a text response </li>
  <li>Playing the text response back to the user using the Google Text to Speech program  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2> Notes </h2>
This simplified version of the program is currently in single run mode, meaning that it closes after every task.
